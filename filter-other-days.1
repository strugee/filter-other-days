.TH FILTER-OTHER-DAYS 1 "1 November 2017" "1.0.1"
.SH NAME
filter-other-days \- filter logfiles for today's date in an Artificial
Ignorance-compatible way
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B filter-other-days
.SH DESCRIPTION
Filter logfiles for today's date in an Artificial Ignorance-compatible
way - i.e. only throw away entries that we're sure
.I aren't
from today. This is implemented by using
.B grep -v
on other dates instead of
.B grep
on today's date.

The rationale here is that it's better to receive irrelevant
information than it is to miss relevant information.

Note that
.B filter-other-days
computes today's date at startup. If the time rolls over to a new day
during execution, this will not be accounted for.

.SH OPTIONS
.B filter-other-days
accepts input on stdin only.
.TP
.BR --help ", " -h
Print help text and exit
.TP
.BR --version ", " -v
Print version information and exit

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
filter-other-days < logfile
Filter logfile for entries from today.
.TP
cat daemon.log syslog.log | filter-other-days
Filter daemon.log and syslog.log for entries from today.

.SH BUGS
Bugs are tracked in GitHub:
.I https://github.com/strugee/filter-other-days/issues
\.

There are surely many, many styles of logfile timestamps that
.B filter-other-days
does not recognize. If you encounter such a style, please file a bug.

.B filter-other-days
is designed to require only POSIX but was developed on a system with a
GNU userland. There may be implicit dependencies on GNU extensions
lurking in the codebase. If
.B filter-other-days
.I should
run on your system, but does not, please file a bug.
